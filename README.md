# Snake-Game
That's a classic snake game made with Java.  
I have created this game to get familiar with the concept of game loops and 
to apply what I learn with the course [Beginner 2D Game Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ).  
To start playing:  
1- Download the project.  
2- Go to src/launcher/Launcher.java  
3- Run it!.  

Here's a picture of the game:
